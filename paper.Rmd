## Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Surprisingly, the size of this dataset is not very large.

### Embedding plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Conclusion

This is a conclusion. Clearly, our hypothesis was confirmed.
